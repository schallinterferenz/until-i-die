# UNTIL I DIE MOD (Compilation) for 7 Days To Die

First of all we want to say, that every mod/s, except UNTILiDIE mod/folder, was not created by us. Please contribute to the developers, if possible!

## IMPORTANT NOTE / READ THIS!!!

Sadly, we could not upload one or several mod/s, due to a file size restriction (File mustn't be over 100MB). 
You have to download them manually and insert them into the 7 Days to Die/Mods folder. 

**Tactical Weapons** Mod: https://7daystodiemods.com/tactical-weapons/

# Install

Just download this repository and copy the content into:

**Windows** : (example) G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

If you don't have the folder "Mods", just create it :) 

**Start the GameLauncher and deactivate Easy Anti Cheat (EAC). If you don't do this, the Mods will not be loaded!!**
